This chapter concerns the writers of this tutorial. When writing, there are a few standards to follow in order to maximize consistency throughout the tutorial.

## Styling

These guidelines concern the styling of the document.

### Tables

* Sentences and phrases within table cells generally shouldn't end with a period.
* Tables introducing opcodes should have the opcodes in **bold** and have at least the three columns as seen in the example below.

| Opcode | Full name | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LDA** | Load into accumulator | Load a value into A |

## Terminology

| Rule | Example |
| :--- | :--- |
| When referring to the `Ricoh 5A22` processor, use `the SNES` instead | `The SNES` is capable of entering 8-bit or 16-bit mode |
| When referring to a specific area in the SNES memory, always prepend `address` to it, preferably with the memory area \(i.e. `RAM`\) | \(The\) `RAM address` $7E0000 contains \[...\] |
| When referring to the A, X and Y registers, just use `A`, `X` or `Y` | `A` is now in 8-bit mode. `X` is used to index addresses |
| When referring to values, always prepend `value` to it | A contains the `value` $00 |

## Example codes

* Code shall use indentation when there are labels, sublabels or plus/minus labels on the same line as an instruction. The amount of indentation equals the length of the longest aforementioned type of label in the code block, including colon \("`:`"\), plus two additional spaces.
  * Code shall use whitespace for indentation, not tabs.
* Opcodes are written entirely in uppercase \(e.g.: `LDA`\).
* Labels are written in PascalCase \(e.g.: `Label1:`\).
* Sublabels are written entirely in lower, underscore-case and the name should semantically suit the parent label, without redundancy \(e.g.: `.return`\).
* Defines are written in PascalCase \(e.g.: `!SomeDefine`\).
* Direct data \(`db`, `dw`, `dl`, `dd`\) and opcode length specifiers \(`.b`, `.w`, `.l`\) are written entirely in lowercase.
* Comment indicators \(i.e. `;`\) shall start on column 20, and left-padded by whitespace, not tabs.
  * If there's no space for a comment on column 20, it will start on the same line.
* Comment indicators shall be followed by a whitespace, before the comment itself.
* There will be an extra new line after the opcodes `RTS`, `RTL`, `RTI`, `JMP`, `JML`, `BRA`, `BRL`.
* These are guidelines which are to be followed as strictly as possible, but there may be exceptional cases.

Example:

```text
SomeLabel:         ; This label is on its own line
LDA.b #$42
STA $00            ; This is a comment
RTS

.table:
db $01,$02,$03,$04 ; Another comment

.second_table:
db $01,$02,$03,$04,$01,$02,$03,$04 ; An exceptional comment

TestLabel:  LDA #$02 ; This label is on the same line as an instruction
            STA $01
            BNE +
            NOP
+           RTS      ; The code is indented according to "TestLabel"
```
