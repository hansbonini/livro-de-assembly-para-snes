# Hardware vectors

Hardware vectors are a group of pointers that define how the SNES should handle certain interrupts within the ROM. Each vector is two bytes in size and point to instructions located in bank `$00`. The hardware vectors are grouped by the [two modes of the SNES](../processor-flags-and-registers/flags.md): "emulation mode" vectors and "native mode" vectors.

## Native mode vectors

These vectors come into play when the SNES runs in native mode \(E=0\).

| ROM address | Vector | Additional notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `$00:FFE0` | Unused |  |
| `$00:FFE2` | Unused |  |
| `$00:FFE4` | COP vector | Triggered by the [COP opcode](misc.md) |
| `$00:FFE6` | BRK vector | Triggered by the [BRK opcode](misc.md) |
| `$00:FFE8` | ABORT vector | Unused by the SNES |
| `$00:FFEA` | NMI vector | Triggered by the SNES V-Blank Interrupt |
| `$00:FFEC` | Unused |  |
| `$00:FFEE` | IRQ vector | Triggered by the SNES H/V-Timer or external interrupt |

## Emulation mode vectors

These vectors come into play when the SNES runs in emulation mode \(E=1\).

| ROM address | Vector | Additional notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `$00:FFF0` | Unused |  |
| `$00:FFF2` | Unused |  |
| `$00:FFF4` | COP vector |  |
| `$00:FFF6` | Unused |  |
| `$00:FFF8` | ABORT vector | Unused by the SNES |
| `$00:FFFA` | NMI vector |  |
| `$00:FFFC` | RESET vector | Triggered by SNES soft/hard reset |
| `$00:FFFE` | IRQ/BRK vector | It's possible to differentiate between the two using the [BRK flag](../processor-flags-and-registers/flags.md) |

## Example setup

Here's an example setup with the most commonly used vectors, which can be used in homebrew SNES ROMs. Note that the labels must be located in bank `$00` \(which is located within the same bank as this setup\).

```text
ORG $00FFE0

; Native mode
dw $FFFF           ; Unused
dw $FFFF           ; Unused
dw $FFFF           ; COP
dw $FFFF           ; BRK
dw $FFFF           ; ABORT
dw NativeNMI       ; NMI
dw $FFFF           ; Unused
dw NativeIRQ       ; IRQ

; Emulation mode
dw $FFFF           ; Unused
dw $FFFF           ; Unused
dw $FFFF           ; COP
dw $FFFF           ; Unused
dw $FFFF           ; ABORT
dw $FFFF           ; NMI
dw Reset           ; RESET
dw $FFFF           ; IRQ/BRK
```

Because homebrew programmers generally want to run their program in native mode, all vectors in emulation mode, save for reset, have been ignored. Furthermore, nothing is done with the `BRK` and `COP` vectors as these are opcodes which generally are unused.
